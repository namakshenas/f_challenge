## Power BI Dashboard - Profitability and Customer Segmentation
In this task, I've been asked to Create a Power BI dashboard  that provides insights into the following: 
- **Regional Profitability**: Visualize profitability across different regions, including which  regions have the highest and lowest profit margins. 
- **Customer Segmentation**: Visualize customer segments by profitability, CLV, and risk of  churn. 
- **Discount Effectiveness**: Analyze the impact of discounts on profitability. Show whether  discounted sales are leading to higher profits or just increasing volume at lower margins.
- **Price Sensitivity Analysis**: Identify which product categories or regions are most price sensitive (i.e., where lower prices significantly increase sales).

#### Bonus tasks:
- Implement drill-down capabilities in the dashboard (e.g., from Region to Country to City). 
- Include KPIs such as "Top 10 Most Profitable Customers" and "Top 5 Underperforming  Products." 

#### What can this dashboard do? (to be discussed...)
> The dashboard highlights the need for a targeted approach to pricing and discounting strategies across different regions and customer segments. Optimizing discount levels, refining pricing strategies in price-sensitive regions, and focusing on high-value customer retention will probably drive profitability while minimizing the risk of margin erosion. (Let's assume that the pricing unit is in euros).
