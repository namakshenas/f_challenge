## Power BI Dashboard - Profitability and Customer Segmentation
In this task, I've been asked to Create a Power BI dashboard  that provides insights into the following: 
- **Regional Profitability**: Visualize profitability across different regions, including which  regions have the highest and lowest profit margins. 
- Customer Segmentation: Visualize customer segments by profitability, CLV, and risk of  churn. 
- Discount Effectiveness: Analyze the impact of discounts on profitability. Show whether  discounted sales are leading to higher profits or just increasing volume at lower margins. â€¢ Price Sensitivity Analysis: Identify which product categories or regions are most price sensitive (i.e., where lower prices significantly increase sales).

#### plus
- Implement drill-down capabilities in the dashboard (e.g., from Region to Country to City). 
- Include KPIs such as "Top 10 Most Profitable Customers" and "Top 5 Underperforming  Products."
